# SharpVk-Docs

This project is an automated extract of the Vulkan API reference document from the asciidoc source files at [Vulkan-Docs](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/tree/1.0/doc/specs/vulkan/chapters), designed for use in generated code bindings (primarily [SharpVk](https://github.com/FacticiusVir/SharpVk).

The [output file](https://github.com/FacticiusVir/SharpVk-Docs/blob/master/Docs/vkDocs.xml) is language-agnostic, so feel free to use it in your own projects, but bear in mind that the content of this document is originally written by the Khronos Group and their [copyrights](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/blob/1.0/doc/specs/vulkan/man/copyright-ccby.txt) apply.
